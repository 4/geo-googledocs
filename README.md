# MapBox for Google Docs

MapBox for Google Docs is a set of tools that make it easy to use data from Google Docs Spreadsheets in [TileMill](http://tilemill.com). TileMill is an open source map design studio.

## Uses

MapBox for Google Docs will tackle common geodata processing tasks:

- **Export spreadsheet data to GeoJSON** Any spreadsheet with geocodes (longitude and latitude cooridinates) can be exported to a TileMill-ready file. After exporting, just copy the GeoJSON file to your `TileMill/files/data` directory. 
- **Geocode arbitrary addresses** If your spreadsheet does not have geocodes, you can add them using a geocoding service like those provided by Yahoo PlaceFinder or Google Maps. (This feature is coming soon.)
