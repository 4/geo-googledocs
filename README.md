# Geo for Google Docs

## A MapBox Project

Geo for Google Docs is a set of tools that make it easy to use data from
Google Docs Spreadsheets in [TileMill](http://tilemill.com), an open source
map design studio.

## Uses

- **Export spreadsheet data to [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/)**
  Any spreadsheet with geocodes (longitude and latitude
  coordinates) can be exported to a TileMill-ready
  file. After exporting, just copy the GeoJSON file to your
  `TileMill/files/data` directory. 

## Roadmap

- **Geocode arbitrary addresses** If your spreadsheet does not have
  geocodes, you can add them using a geocoding service like those provided by
  Yahoo PlaceFinder or Google Maps. (This feature is coming soon.)
